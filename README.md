## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. I make no claim to be an expert in these languages, although I'm positive some of you are.

I prefer idiomatic examples of the language's features, so avoid personal styles as much as possible, even if your personal style is objectively better - be it more readable, succinct, or expressive.
